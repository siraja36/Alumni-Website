The objective of the project is to develop a user friendly website which provides all kinds of information and details of the Alumni activities, throughout the year and so on, who are part of the institution. Modules of the project are

- Site Administration
- News and Events
- Alumni Network
- Student’s Forum
- Job Portal
- Achievements

The Website is being developed using ASP.NET as front end and Sql Server as back end. Alumni’s of this institution can view the Events taking place in the institution and also read the Newsletter posted in the site. Each an every student of the institution can interact with Alumni through Student’s Forum and can view the job’s vacant from the Job portal link. The website contains Chapters that provide detailed information about Alumni activities taking place in different parts of the world. Alumni can maintain their profile details more efficiently by deciding what others can see and not. The profile page of alumni also has an chat feature that enables the users to chat across locations. Finally, if any Alumni have a query they can drop a mail to the Alumni Officer through the Email facility provided in the website itself.
